# Jarvis: A Python-based Virtual Assistant using OpenAI API
Jarvis is a virtual assistant program built using Python and OpenAI API. Inspired by Tony Stark's AI assistant in the Marvel universe, Jarvis aims to assist users with various tasks through voice commands.

## Features
- **Voice Recognition:** Jarvis listens to user commands via microphone input.
- **Natural Language Processing:** Utilizes OpenAI's powerful text generation model to understand and respond to user queries naturally.
- **Customizable Interaction:** Users can customize the interaction by modifying user and bot names.
- **Continuous Learning:** Jarvis learns from each interaction, improving its responses over time.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- speech_recognition library
- pyttsx3 library
- OpenAI API key

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: **git clone https://github.com/your_username/jarvis.git**
2. Install dependencies: **pip install -r requirements.txt**
3. Obtain an OpenAI API key and replace **'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'** with your key in the **openai.api_key** variable within the **jarvis.py** file.

## Usage
1. Run the jarvis.py script: **python jarvis.py**
2. Speak "Jarvis" to activate the assistant and begin giving voice commands.
